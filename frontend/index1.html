                        The Transform Bottom Trawling Coalition today unveiled a new grants programme to provide direct support to members’ campaigns tackling bottom trawling and rebuilding oceans worldwide. This initiative is a key component of the coalition’s efforts to address the emergency facing the world’s oceans due to harmful fishing practices.

By pairing this financial backing with access to technical resources and connecting grantees to the global network of members – which now includes 95 organisations from 44 countries  – the coalition, convened by Blue Ventures, is building a powerful movement for change.

The new programme prioritises members from low- and middle-income countries, fishers’ organisations and grassroots networks. It provides funding for campaigns that expand or strengthen Inshore Exclusion Zones, end bottom trawling subsidies, or work to stop the practice in protected or untapped areas.

The coalition’s first cohort of grantees comprises the Canoe and Fishing Gear Owners Association of Ghana (CaFGOAG), the Indonesian Traditional Fisherfolk Union (KNTI), the Cameroonian environmental NGO TUBE AWU, the Indian environmental NGO Dakshin Foundation and the Vietnam Syndicate for Workers in Fisheries (VSFW).

Together they will launch five projects aimed at: strengthening small-scale fishers’ rights against industrial bottom trawlers in Ghana; uncovering illegal trawling in Indonesia; protecting Cameroon’s first marine protected area from bottom trawlers; supporting a just transition away from reduction fishing in India; and developing policy proposals to end bottom trawling in Vietnam’s Tonkin Gulf.

The Coalition believes that combatting bottom trawling and restoring oceans requires a united, global effort with small-scale fishers and coastal communities at its heart. The grants programme is a critical step in ensuring that campaigners globally have access to the funding, technical support and networks they need to achieve lasting change.

Keep up to date with these projects, and the coalition’s work across the globe, by signing up to its regular newsletter and following the conversation on X, Instagram and Facebook.
